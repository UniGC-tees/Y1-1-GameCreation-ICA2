## Player
### Movement
The player will move by strafing left and right along the lanes with the A and D keys, however if there is a wall to the side of them, instead they will briefly be able to slide along it by holding down the direction of the wall. If holding onto the wall direction once the wall has ended, they will fall to their death.
## Segments
Random "segments" will be generated dynamicaly throughout a run, these are each made up of a [track](#Tracks), along with obsticales
