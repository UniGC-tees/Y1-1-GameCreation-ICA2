## Player
### Movement
The player will move by strafing left and right along the lanes with the A and D keys, however if there is a wall to the side of them, instead they will briefly be able to slide along it by holding down the direction of the wall. If holding onto the wall direction once the wall has ended, they will fall to their death.
## Segments
Random "segments" will be generated dynamicaly throughout a run, these are each made up of a [track](#Tracks) and props that make it fit in with the world.
When first colliding with the start of any segment, the next segment will be generated (hidden in the fog) at the end of it.
### Tracks
Tracks consit of three lanes. The middle lane is generated by the level disigner using the spline tool and the other lanes generate off of that + or - the middle lane point's right vector depending on which side it is.
### Obstacles
Each [track](#Tracks) will have plenty of obstacles that will randomly generate the type
#### Duck
#### Speed Boost
